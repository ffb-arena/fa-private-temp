FFB TO-DO
---------
-mechanics to fix 
	petals:
		-make rose in more

	code and bugs:
		-checks
		-random disconnects
		-more consistent inventory.js variable names (esp. with const sizes)

	rendering:
		-sometimes loadout/inventory bugs out and displays wrong petals
		-make gallery and loadout scale with scroll bar
   		-making petal swaps proper ui speed
		-way to delete petals
   		-fix discoloured "echo"
   		-faces
   		-player hurt animations
   		-make petals on petal background turn clockwise
   		-don't start petal background until loading is stopped (also better loading screen, start onload)
		-SUCK IT UP AND LEARN HOW TO LERP
		-container for menu for easier hiding
		-use florrText on death screen
		-option for disabling background (or just make it less laggy)

	physics:
		-petals always evenly spaced
		-petal bouncing (also on spawn)
		-on mouse stop, don't stop player immediately
		-petal lag is elliptical???
		-petal lag in general
		-wasd movement
		-knockback in general
		-bug where collision where both are still
		-collisions sometimes NaN positions
		-random 0, 0 debug info
		-lag when switching directions with mouse

-far future
	-tdm
	-yy opposite knockback
