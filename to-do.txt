-fix gallery size
-petal stats

-mechanics to fix 
    code and bugs:
        -checks
        -random disconnects
        -more consistent inventory.js variable names
		-localStorage names/loadout/level

		-petals always evenly spaced
        -petal bouncing (also on spawn)
        -on mouse stop, don't stop player immediately
        -petal lag is elliptical???
        -petal lag in general
        -wasd movement
        -scuffed still knockback (not consistent)
        -knockback in general

        -collisions sometimes NaN positions
        -random 0, 0 debug info
        -lag when switching directions with mouse

-far future
