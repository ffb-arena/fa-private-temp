-petal stats

-mechanics to fix 
    code and bugs:
        -checks
        -random disconnects
        -more consistent inventory.js variable names (esp. with const sizes)
		-localStorage names/loadout/level

    rendering:
		-only render gallery and loadout on loading
		-make gallery and loadout scale with scroll bar
		-fix movement helper
        -making petal swaps proper ui speed
        -fix discoloured "echo"
        -faces
        -player hurt animations
        -make petals on petal background turn clockwise
        -don't start petal background until loading is stopped (also better loading screen)
		-make more petals when not on tab
		-SUCK IT UP AND LEARN HOW TO LERP
		-container for menu for easier hiding
		-use florrText on death screen
		-option for disabling background (or just make it less laggy)

    physics:
		-petals always evenly spaced
        -petal bouncing (also on spawn)
        -on mouse stop, don't stop player immediately
        -petal lag is elliptical???
        -petal lag in general
        -wasd movement
        -scuffed still knockback (not consistent)
        -knockback in general
        -bug where collision where both are still
        -collisions sometimes NaN positions
        -random 0, 0 debug info
        -lag when switching directions with mouse

-far future
    -tdm
    -yy opposite knockback
