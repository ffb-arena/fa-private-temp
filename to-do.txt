-mechanics to fix 
	petals:

		-suicide key
		-checks
		-random disconnects
		-more consistent inventory.js variable names (esp. with const sizes)

	rendering:
		-garden sometimes takes up too much space
		-sometimes loadout/inventory bugs out and displays wrong petals

		-container for menu for easier hiding
		-use florrText on death screen
		-option for disabling background (or just make it less laggy)

	physics:
		-petals always evenly spaced
		-petal bouncing (also on spawn)
		-on mouse stop, don't stop player immediately
		-petal lag is elliptical???
		-petal lag in general
		-wasd movement
		-knockback in general
		-bug where collision where both are still
		-collisions sometimes NaN positions
		-random 0, 0 debug info
		-lag when switching directions with mouse

-far future
	-tdm
	-yy opposite knockback
	-remove while on background type selecting
